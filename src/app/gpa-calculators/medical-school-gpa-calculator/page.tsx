  {
    question: 'What GPA do you need for medical school?',
    answer: 'Most medical schools require a minimum GPA of 3.0, but competitive schools typically require 3.5 or higher for overall GPA and 3.4+ for science GPA. Top-tier medical schools like Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and Stanford typically require 3.7+ overall and 3.6+ science GPA.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is GPA calculated for med school applications?',
    answer: 'Med school GPA is calculated by multiplying each course\'s grade points by credit hours, summing all grade points, then dividing by total credit hours. Use the standard 4.0 scale where A=4.0, A-=3.7, B+=3.3, etc. AMCAS recalculates GPA using their own standards.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a good GPA for medical school?',
    answer: 'A good GPA for medical school depends on the school tier. For top schools, aim for 3.7+ overall and 3.6+ science GPA. For mid-tier schools, 3.5+ overall and 3.4+ science GPA is competitive. Below-average GPAs can still be competitive with strong MCAT scores and other application components.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do medical schools look at science GPA?',
    answer: 'Yes, medical schools heavily weigh science GPA (BCPM GPA). BCPM includes Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Math courses. Many schools have separate GPA cutoffs for science courses. A strong science GPA is crucial because medical school curricula are science-heavy.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is a 3.7 GPA good for medical school?',
    answer: 'A 3.7 GPA is excellent for medical school admission. It places you in the top quartile of applicants and makes you competitive for most medical schools, including many top programs. Combined with a strong MCAT score, a 3.7 GPA significantly boosts your chances.',

                A medical school GPA is your Grade Point Average as calculated specifically for medical school admissions.
                Unlike your undergraduate institution's GPA, medical schools use standardized calculations through AMCAS (American Medical College Application Service).
                Your GPA is one of the most important factors in medical school admissions, often carrying equal weight with your MCAT score.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Medical schools evaluate two types of GPA: your overall GPA (all undergraduate courses) and your science GPA (BCPM - Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Math).
                The science GPA is particularly important because medical school curricula are heavily science-based.
                Admissions committees want to ensure applicants can handle rigorous science coursework.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Your GPA doesn't just reflect academic ability - it also demonstrates work ethic, time management, and resilience.
                Medical schools know that pre-med coursework is challenging, so they look for students who can maintain strong academic performance
                while balancing extracurricular activities, research, clinical experience, and leadership roles.

                  💡 <strong>Key Point:</strong> Medical schools recalculate your GPA using AMCAS standards,

                AMCAS includes all undergraduate courses from accredited institutions, including community colleges and study abroad programs.
                However, they exclude graduate-level courses, pass/fail courses, and some repeated courses.
                Understanding these rules helps you calculate a more accurate pre-med GPA estimate.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                If you repeated a course, AMCAS typically counts the most recent grade in the GPA calculation, so be sure to track retakes separately.
                Also, some schools recalculate GPA using their own rules, so the calculator is a helpful estimate but always verify with the schools you plan to apply to.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                For the most accurate calculation, use only courses from your undergraduate degree and apply the standard grading scale.

                It's important to remember that GPA is only one piece of your medical school application.
                Schools use holistic admissions, considering MCAT scores, clinical experience, research, leadership, and personal statements.
                A lower GPA can be offset by exceptional MCAT performance or compelling extracurricular activities.

                Many schools have GPA cutoffs below which applications are automatically screened out.
                However, these cutoffs are typically set at 3.0 or lower, so most applicants with reasonable GPAs can still apply broadly.
                The key is finding the right balance between reach schools and safety schools based on your complete profile.

                Remember: medical schools value GPA improvement and upward trends. If you've had a rough start but show strong recent performance,
                admissions committees will take that into account. The key is demonstrating your ability to handle medical school rigor.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Post-baccalaureate programs and Special Master's Programs can be excellent options for GPA repair.
                These programs allow you to take pre-med courses as a non-degree student and can significantly improve your science GPA.
                Many successful applicants use these programs to strengthen their applications.

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Most medical schools require a minimum GPA of 3.0, but competitive schools typically require 3.5 or higher for overall GPA and 3.4+ for science GPA.
                    Top-tier medical schools like Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and Stanford typically require 3.7+ overall and 3.6+ science GPA.

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Med school GPA is calculated by multiplying each course's grade points by credit hours, summing all grade points, then dividing by total credit hours.
                    Use the standard 4.0 scale where A=4.0, A-=3.7, B+=3.3, etc. AMCAS recalculates GPA using their own standards.

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    A good GPA for medical school depends on the school tier. For top schools, aim for 3.7+ overall and 3.6+ science GPA.
                    For mid-tier schools, 3.5+ overall and 3.4+ science GPA is competitive. Below-average GPAs can still be competitive with strong MCAT scores and other application components.

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Yes, medical schools heavily weigh science GPA (BCPM GPA). BCPM includes Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Math courses.
                    Many schools have separate GPA cutoffs for science courses. A strong science GPA is crucial because medical school curricula are science-heavy.

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    A 3.7 GPA is excellent for medical school admission. It places you in the top quartile of applicants and makes you competitive for most medical schools,
                    including many top programs. Combined with a strong MCAT score, a 3.7 GPA significantly boosts your chances.
